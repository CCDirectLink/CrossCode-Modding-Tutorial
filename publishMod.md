# Share a mod

## Requirements

* [Making a mod](./makingAMod.md)

## Steps

1. Open your mod folder that contains the `package.json` file
2. Select all files/folders needed for the mod
3. Create a zip archive from these files. On Windows you can do this using right click > send to > zip-archived folder

You can already share this file

4. Rename the .zip file to .ccmod

This allows other users to simply drag the file into the mods folder and not have to worry about extracting it

## Publish on the official list

Since the process of approving a mod for the official list is a bit complicated (and is likely to change in the future) the best way is to:
* Publish your source code on [Github](https://github.com/)
* Make sure you have a correct version number
* Create a [Github Release](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository) - you can upload your .ccmod file there
* Message (an admin) on the [CrossCode Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/TFs6n5v) to add your mod to the list
